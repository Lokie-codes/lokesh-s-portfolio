Here are the projects that I've worked on.


### Face Recognition Based Attendance System
Welcome to the world of modern attendance systems! In this era of advanced technology, traditional attendance methods are being replaced by innovative solutions. \
One such solution is the Face Recognition Based Attendance System. \
This system combines the power of face recognition technology with the versatility of Django Rest Framework (DRF) as the backend and Flutter as the frontend.

With the Face Recognition Based Attendance System, the tedious task of manual attendance taking becomes a thing of the past. \
By leveraging the capabilities of DRF and Flutter, we create a seamless and efficient solution that automates the attendance process, improves accuracy, and enhances overall productivity. \
