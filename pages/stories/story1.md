# The Guy

On a sunny day, a man with a rugged face and weak physique stood on a raft, staring at the deep blue sea beneath a distant sky.

His stomach growled like a newborn, and he picked up a stake he had earlier broken from the raft. Peering into the water, he saw a dolphin and its baby approaching.

With no time to think, he pulled himself out of the water, faced with two options: a giant dolphin he couldn't manage, or the baby dolphin passing along. Taking a deep breath, he snatched the baby dolphin from the water and threw it onto the raft. Holding it against the raft with one hand and the stake in the other, he raised the stake high, aiming at the little dolphin as it whistled in fear.

He **couldn't** do it.

He released the baby dolphin back into the water, and both dolphins swam away. The man grew drowsy and fell overboard. Day turned to night, and the chill winds wouldn't let him sleep.

Night passed, the sun rose, and his hunger grew. This cycle repeated for many days. One day, a sharp pain in his gut felt like a black hole inside him. Unable to bear it any longer, he took the stake and struck it over his hand, splitting two fingers and spilling blood over the raft and into the ocean. Removing the nails, he ate them.

Soon, sharks surrounded him, lured by his blood. With a weak limb, he held the stake upright and his head firm. As a shark attacked, he struck it like a thunderbolt, killing it and getting a chunk of its flesh. He defended himself from the others until they fled. As sunset approached, he lay back, biting into the shark meat, and saw dark clouds gathering.

Suddenly, rain poured down. He swiftly removed his shaggy shirt, spread it over his arms, and stood erect, collecting water to suck from it. Noticing his raft speeding up, he saw a whirlpool ahead. Hurriedly, he stretched his shirt, tied himself to the raft, and held on tight as they were sucked into the whirlpool.

Bubbling out air, he closed his eyes.

"Hello, can you hear me?" a woman's voice spoke.

With blurred vision, as focused light flashed on his face, the man found himself on a chair with wires attached, making weird noises in an empty dark room.

The woman repeated herself, and he murmured, "Where am I? What happened to me?"

She smiled and said, "Nothing to worry about. You were tested in our simulator for endurance, and you've passed. You are in our headquarters, Mr. Harihar. Welcome to the Secretive Intelligence Bureau (SIB)."

**The beginning is yet to begin...**
